# Trailing-Zeroes-in-Factorial
This code finds out the no of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a .


Input
There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input (equal to about 100000). It stands for the number of numbers to follow. Then there are T lines, each containing exactly one positive integer number N, 1 <= N <= 1000000000.

Output
For every number N, output a single line containing the single non-negative integer Z(N).
